# spark-AR-lols

Figured I'd put my experiments with Spark AR on github so people can download them and try them on their phone/tweak existing settings to see how they work.

lol1 and lol2 are good examples of varying 3D objects, face tracker abilities, texture settings, and face-events. lol2 particularly has good examples of how the node editor works.

lol3+ are just formal experiments, based on the fact that when Spark detects your face it generates a texture out of your face, distorted so it appropriately maps to a 3D mesh of your face. Loading the distorted face onto a flat surface naturally looks fucked up!

I'll explain more about all this later.

But if you want to try this out on your phone:

1. Download Spark AR Studio
2. Download these files
3. Download Spark AR Player on your phone
4. Open one of these files
5. Plug your phone into your computer
6. Click the "Mirror" button in the top right of the Spark AR window
7. Click "Refresh" next to your phone
8. Yay! Now you have this effect loaded on your phone and can try it out whenever and wherever you want
